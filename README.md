# sephora-coding-game

Little exercises to show your coding skills!

## Basic functionnalities

- To build app and execute the code contained in the _src/index.ts_ file, run the `yarn start` command.
- To prevent relaunching the yarn start command everytime, execution can be launched in watch mode using the `yarn dev` command.
- Tests can be launched with `yarn test`
- To ease test driven development on given files, tests can be launched in watch mode with `yarn tdd <pattern>` with `<pattern>` a pattern matching the given files path

## Game goal

The applicant should implement the code responding to the need express by each questions. The implementation is completely free: new files can be created anywhere and existing code can be modified at will. **Providing tests for every answer is strongly encouraged**.
